# Data Structures in Python - A Primer

This project contains implementation and solutions of popular Data Structures and associated problems.

## Motivation
---
With many resources available for practicing data structures for interviews in other popular languages like C, C++ and Java, I aim to create a central repo for all things related to pythonic implementation and approach for Data Structures compiled here.

## Usage Guide
---

For anyone landing here with an aim to start competitive coding; Python is not recommended, I would suggest you go for C++ based work, because of the speed it offers.

For people landing here with an intent to clear coding interviews, I personally feel language should not matter much, unless the coding rounds are timed in an online platform; which they rarely are.

Please go through the implementaion of the Data Structure and then go through the basic problems which are based off it.

Please feel free to contribute to this project on any level. Here are the [guidelines](https://github.com/naagarjunsa/data-structures-python-primer/CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute.

## Credits
---
This repo is inspired by the work of [DonneMartin on System Design](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer).
I recommend senior software developers to check it out to assist their system design rounds in interviews.
